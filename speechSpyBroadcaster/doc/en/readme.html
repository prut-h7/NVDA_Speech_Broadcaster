<h3>NVDA Speech Broadcaster add-on</h3>
<p>Author: Pruthivi Raj Mohapatra</p>
<p>An <a href="https://nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> add-on to broadcast speech via UDP.
It can broadcast speech generated in the local network.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>To configure this add-on, open the NVDA menu, go to Preferences, then Settings, then Speech Broadcaster.</p>
<p>Note: the add-on can only be configured while in the Normal Configuration profile of NVDA. The add-on is not profile-aware.</p>
<p>The following settings are available:
* The UDP Group. The UDP Group specifies the address where to connect the UDP Receiver. The default value is kept as 224.1.1.1
* The UDP Port. The UDP Port specifies the port where to connect the UDP Receiver. The default value is kept as 5004
* TTL Value. The TTL Value specifies the number of hops in the network. The default value is kept as 2.
* Separator. This combobox lets you choose one of the available utterance separators. See below for more information.
* Custom separator. This field lets you enter a custom utterance separator (see below), which is used if "custom" is chosen in the combobox.</p>
<h4>Utterance separator</h4>
<p>When NVDA speaks something such as "<code>recycle bin  1 of 55</code>" while it's reading your desktop, this is considered two separate utterances. The first one is the item name ("<code>Recycle bin</code>", in this example), and the second is the object position information ("<code>1 of 55</code>", in this example).</p>
<p>Depending on what you are reading, and how you have NVDA configured, there can be several separate utterances that happen during a single speech sequence.</p>
<p>In the normal NVDA log at debug level, each individual utterance is separated with two spaces, as it is written in the example above.</p>
<p>Speech Logger allows you to separate utterances in the same way NVDA does (with two spaces), or by one of a few reasonable alternatives (a newline, a comma and a space, two underscores), or by a custom sequence of your own devising.</p>
<p>If, for example, you wanted your utterance separator to be two dollar signs (<code>$$</code>), you would set the combobox to "custom", and enter "<code>$$</code>" (without the quotes), in the custom separator field. If you wanted it to be a tab, you could enter "<code>\t</code>".</p>
<h3>Starting and stopping broadcasting</h3>
<p>This add-on has one gesture set by default. You can change them in the NVDA Input Gestures Tools category.
Look for "Toggles logging of local speech" and "Toggles logging of remote speech".
* NVDA+Alt+B: start/stop broadcast of local speech.</p>
